I download arduino IDE 
then I did the circuits on it
and I put it in the simulator 
then I download AUTODESK
and opened the circuits from classes 
and I created the circuit
then I searched about SERVO in the seach bar
and I choosed SERVO
and shoose the board and micro servo and connect ther together
and downloaded the code from it 
it will show in arduino
that's it.
For a stepper motor, I put the l293D on a board and installed it with colored wires and connected the CD motor to the battery and put wires between them as well
