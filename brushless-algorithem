we used dc motor instead of brushless motor 
1-using servo library to control ESC
2-creating a servo clas with name as esc
3-specifying the esc signal as DS
4-initialize the signal to 1000
5-read the input from analog A0 and store in val
6-maping the val to minimum and maximum input
7-using val as the signal to esc
